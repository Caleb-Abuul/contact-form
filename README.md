## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to mix `flex` and `grid` effectively to create responsive and dynamic layouts for ease of use and aesthetic beauty.

### Continued development

Going form I want to start using frameworks and libraries such as TailwaindCSS, React, etc. for development of my projects.
